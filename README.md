# Gravity-Simulation
This is a small simulation of how astral bodies affect each other with gravity.
I made it solely to flex on my friend who made something simmilar but it wasn't physicaly correct.

Right now user can't do anything but watch but I plan to put in some GUI so user can make their own scenario.

Made in Monogame with my own ButtonUI library.
